# [L4D2] Minigun & Heavy Machine Gun Damage Modifier
This is a simple SourceMod Plugin that lets you change the base damage of the Minigun against tanks and the Heavy Machine Gun against players in general. I developed this plugin mainly to make the Minigun more balanced in Versus as the base damage was very high and would mow down the Tank quite easily.

# CVars
- `l4d1_minigun_tank_damage` (set to `200` by default)
- `mounted_gun_pz_damage` (set to `50` by default)

# Requirements
- [SourceMod 1.11+](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=stable)

# Supported Games
- Left 4 Dead 2
